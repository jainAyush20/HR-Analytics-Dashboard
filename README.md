# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
I developed this project using PowerBi , creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages including data cleaning, data preprocessing and data visualization.

Project Overview 
✤ The task involves developing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to HR metrics such as employee satisfaction, turnover, retention, recruitment, and diversity, along with creating a dashboard to track and communicate progress.

✤ This project focuses on analyzing HR data to gain insights into employee performance, retention rates, recruitment effectiveness, and workforce diversity. The goal is to provide HR leaders and stakeholders with the tools to optimize workforce management, improve employee satisfaction, and align HR practices with organizational goals.

Data Source: HR Analytics Data
This dataset includes a wide variety of HR-related information, such as employee demographics, job titles, hiring details, salary information, performance reviews, promotions, turnover rates, and more. It helps identify trends in recruitment, employee performance, diversity, and workforce dynamics.

Tools:
Power BI: For creating dashboards and data visualizations that will allow HR stakeholders to easily interpret and explore HR-related metrics.
DAX: To create custom calculations and KPIs, such as employee retention rate, turnover rate, and diversity index.
Data Preparation Steps:
Data Cleansing:

Ensured the HR data was free from errors, duplicates, or missing values, and standardized key columns (e.g., job titles, departments).
Data Transformation:

Structured the data in a way that it is easy to analyze, including calculating key metrics such as employee tenure, salary distributions, and performance scores.
Data Modeling:

Established relationships between tables like employees, departments, performance reviews, and compensation to facilitate comprehensive analysis.
Data Analysis (DAX):

Applied DAX functions to calculate KPIs such as Employee Retention Rate, Turnover Rate, Performance Index, and Diversity Ratio.
Data Visualization:

Created engaging dashboards using Power BI's visualizations (e.g., bar charts, KPIs, pie charts, and tables) to convey HR insights effectively.
Insights:

Uncovered insights into employee satisfaction, recruitment effectiveness, and turnover causes, providing recommendations to improve employee retention and diversity.
Key Insights:
Employee Demographics:

The workforce consists of X% male and X% female employees, with the largest age group being 30-40 years.
Most employees belong to the Sales and Engineering departments, but the Marketing department shows higher turnover rates.
Employee Tenure:

The average employee tenure is X years, with the majority of employees (X%) having been with the company for less than 2 years, indicating high recruitment but potentially low retention.
Employee Turnover Rate:

The overall turnover rate is X%, with higher turnover observed among employees in the Sales and Customer Service departments.
Employee turnover is higher among junior-level employees compared to senior-level employees, indicating potential issues with career progression or job satisfaction.
Retention Rate:

The company has a X% retention rate, with employees staying longer in departments such as Engineering and IT.
Retention is lowest in departments that have higher turnover, such as Sales and Customer Service, suggesting that intervention may be needed.
Recruitment Effectiveness:

X% of new hires come from internal recruitment while X% are sourced externally.
The time-to-hire is X days, and the cost-per-hire is $X. External hires have a higher turnover rate compared to internal hires.
Performance Metrics:

The average employee performance rating is X (out of 5). X% of employees received ratings of 4 or higher, while X% received ratings below average.
There is a notable correlation between tenure and performance rating, with employees who have been with the company longer performing better.
Diversity & Inclusion:

X% of the workforce is from diverse backgrounds, with an increase in gender and ethnic diversity over the last few years.
The diversity ratio has improved significantly in Leadership and Executive Roles, but there is still room for improvement in technical departments.
Visualization Strategy:
The dashboard will use Power BI to visualize these key insights in an engaging and actionable format, allowing HR teams to track performance over time and make data-driven decisions.

Employee Demographics Overview:

A pie chart or bar chart visualizing the gender distribution, age group distribution, and department distribution of the workforce.
A tree map or donut chart showing employee distribution by department, gender, and age group.
Employee Tenure and Retention:

A histogram or bar chart showing the distribution of employee tenure (e.g., number of employees by tenure years).
A KPI card showing the overall retention rate, with comparisons by department and tenure.
Turnover Rate:

A line graph or bar chart displaying turnover rates over time, segmented by department, job level, and employee demographics.
A donut chart showing the distribution of employees who left the company by reason (e.g., voluntary resignation, retirement, etc.).
Recruitment and Hiring Metrics:

A bar chart comparing internal versus external recruitment for different positions and departments.
A scatter plot comparing time-to-hire vs. cost-per-hire, helping HR assess the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of their hiring processes.
Performance Ratings:

A heat map showing the performance distribution across departments or job levels.
A radar chart comparing performance scores between male and female employees or other demographic groups.
Diversity and Inclusion:

A stacked bar chart or line chart tracking diversity trends over time (gender, ethnicity, age).
A diversity index KPI to show overall diversity improvements within different departments and job levels.
KPIs and Dashboards:

A summary KPI dashboard that highlights overall employee retention, turnover, average performance, and diversity metrics.
Dynamic filters to allow HR teams to filter by department, tenure, job level, gender, etc.
Next Steps:
Data Modeling in Power BI:

Import and clean the HR dataset, ensuring relationships between tables (employees, departments, turnover reasons, etc.) are properly set.
Create measures to calculate turnover rate, retention rate, average performance, and other KPIs.
Building Interactive Visuals:

Design interactive visuals that allow HR professionals to filter and drill down into the data, providing flexibility in analyzing different segments of the workforce.
Insight Communication:

Provide actionable insights to HR teams based on data trends (e.g., focus on improving retention in certain departments, improve diversity efforts).
Use the dashboard to make recommendations on improving recruitment, employee engagement, and retention strategies.
